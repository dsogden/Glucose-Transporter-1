# Glucose-Transporter-1
This will house the scripts and analysis done for my GluT1 simulations.

The directories are as follows: RMSD, RMSF, Interhelical Angles (using the principal axes of each transmembrane helix), Water, Hole, Saltbridges, Hydrogen Bonds, PCA.

These will be updated as I continue finishing up the analysis.
